# TTP 201 Applied Data Analysis
Skills for examining, parsing, and analyzing datasets to answer research questions. Application of concepts from econometrics, statistics, and machine learning.

### Course Description :

This course aims to provide students with the resources needed to examine, parse, and analyze
datasets (with a specific aim for answering research questions). This data analysis course
covers a variety of concepts across disciplines of economics, statistics, and machine learning
but with a specific emphasis on application. All techniques will be taught through practical
examples of real-world datasets with enough breadth to understand the most critical concepts
behind various analysis techniques.

The concepts in the class include the exploration of data, gathering and cleaning of data. The
course delves into basic data analysis operations, including basics of examining and inspecting
data (identifying data types, dealing with missing data and outliers, maintaining data integrity).
We will cover a range of regression analysis including parametric (OLS), semi-parametric
(logistic), and non-parametric (GLM, kernel regressions) regressions. Lastly, we will apply the
learned techniques to real data. We will cover a variety of datasets as examples to demonstrate
how to use the software tools.
